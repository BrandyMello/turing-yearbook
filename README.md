# Turing Yearbook

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Clone down this repo.

Because you don't want to be pushing your updates to this boilerplate repository, we're going to have to do a few things to get set up with your own repository.

1. On GitHub, create a new, empty repository and name it something like 'turing-yearbook'.
2. Update the current remote (called "origin") so that it points at the URL of the repository you just created on GitHub. Read how to do this [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url).
3. Once you've updated the remote, you should run `npm install`, commit, and then push your initial commit to your personal repository. You will need to use the `-u` flag when you push (like this: `git push -u origin master`).
4. Run `npm start` to start up your React server. (You will see errors!)
